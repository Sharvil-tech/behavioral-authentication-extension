**DO**: Click green → Show immediate restoration

---

**Trigger New Anomaly**

**Option 2: Orange Button**

**SAY**:
> "If a family member is borrowing my laptop, I enable limited access mode. Watch what happens."

**DO**: 
1. Click orange button
2. Show orange banner
3. Try to visit chase.com → Blocked
4. Point to password field → Disabled

**SAY**:
> "Limited mode blocks sensitive sites and password entry while allowing general browsing."

---

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Problem 1: Extension Won't Load**

**Symptom**: "Manifest file is missing" error

**Cause**: Wrong folder selected

**Fix**:
```
1. Verify path: C:\AltairAI\DataMerge\behavior-authentication\chrome-extension\
2. Check manifest.json exists directly in this folder
3. Don't select parent or child folder
4. Try "Remove" then "Load unpacked" again
```

---

### **Problem 2: Stats Stay at Zero**

**Symptom**: Typing but counters don't increase

**Cause**: Content scripts not injected

**Fix**:
```
1. Refresh webpage (F5)
2. Open NEW tab (Ctrl+T)
3. Extension only works on pages loaded AFTER installation
4. Don't test on chrome:// pages
```

---

### **Problem 3: Anomaly Won't Trigger**

**Symptom**: Typing differently but no alert

**Cause**: Not different enough from baseline

**Fix**:
```
1. Type EXTREMELY slowly (1 key per 2 seconds)
2. Type for 60+ seconds continuously
3. Wait 20-30 seconds for detection
4. Try increasing sensitivity: Settings → High
5. Verify baseline trained (check stats > 200 keystrokes)
```

---

### **Problem 4: Modal Doesn't Appear**

**Symptom**: Page freezes but no buttons show

**Cause**: Popup blocker or file missing

**Fix**:
```
1. Disable popup blockers for extension
2. Check alert/security-alert.html exists
3. Open console (F12) → Look for errors
4. Reload extension
5. Try clicking on frozen area (modal might be hidden)
```

---

### **Problem 5: Limited Mode Not Working**

**Symptom**: Orange button clicked but can still access everything

**Cause**: Restrictions need page refresh

**Fix**:
```
1. Refresh page (F5) after clicking orange
2. Try visiting new sensitive site
3. Check banner appeared at top
4. Console (F12) → Look for "Limited access enabled" log
```

---

## 💬 TALKING POINTS (Q&A)

### **Q: How accurate is it?**

**A**: 
> "The keystroke model achieved 70.5% accuracy on 51 users, which is 36 times better than random guessing. The mouse model achieved 58.2% accuracy on 65 users, which is 38 times better than random. Together, they provide strong multi-modal behavioral authentication."

---

### **Q: Can it be fooled?**

**A**:
> "It's very difficult to replicate someone's exact typing rhythm and mouse patterns. We're measuring timing down to milliseconds. While no security is perfect, behavioral biometrics add a strong continuous authentication layer."

---

### **Q: What about privacy?**

**A**:
> "All behavioral data stays local in Chrome storage. Nothing is transmitted to external servers except the encrypted security alerts. Users control their data and can clear it anytime from settings."

---

### **Q: How was it trained?**

**A**:
> "I used Altair AI Studio's AutoML platform with the CMU keystroke dynamics dataset and Balabit mouse dataset. The platform tested 168 model variations across 8 algorithms and selected the best - a Generalized Linear Model with 70.5% accuracy."

---

### **Q: False positives?**

**A**:
> "The system uses adaptive learning to update your baseline over time. The 65% threshold balances security and usability. Users can adjust sensitivity. In testing, false positives were minimal with proper baseline training."

---

### **Q: Mobile support?**

**A**:
> "Currently Chrome desktop only due to Manifest V3. Mobile browsers have different APIs. Future versions could adapt to mobile touch patterns."

---

### **Q: Can this replace passwords?**

**A**:
> "It's designed as an additional layer, not a replacement. Think of it as continuous two-factor authentication - your password is what you know, your behavior is what you are."

---

### **Q: Performance impact?**

**A**:
> "Minimal. Data is buffered and analyzed in the background every 5 seconds. The AI inference is lightweight JavaScript with pre-calculated thresholds. No noticeable impact on browsing speed."

---

### **Q: Enterprise deployment?**

**A**:
> "The architecture supports it. You'd need to package the extension, set up centralized model training, and configure email webhooks for security teams. The modular design makes this feasible."
