## 🎬 DEMO SCRIPT (10 Minutes)

### **Part 1: Introduction** (2 minutes)

**What to Say**:
> "Today I'm showing you a Chrome extension that uses AI to continuously authenticate users based on their behavioral patterns. Unlike passwords that can be stolen, your typing rhythm and mouse movements are unique to you."

**What to Show**:
1. Click extension icon
2. Show popup with stats
3. Point to real-time counters

---

### **Part 2: How It Works** (3 minutes)

**What to Say**:
> "The extension was trained using Altair AI Studio with real-world datasets. The keystroke model achieved 70.5% accuracy on 20,000 samples from 51 users. It continuously monitors your behavior in the background."

**What to Show**:
1. Open any webpage
2. Start typing
3. Show keystroke counter increasing in real-time
4. Move mouse around
5. Show mouse counter increasing
6. Point to confidence score: "Currently 85% confident this is me"

---

### **Part 3: Anomaly Detection** (3 minutes)

**What to Say**:
> "Now I'll demonstrate what happens when the AI detects unusual behavior - perhaps someone else using my computer."

**What to Do**:
1. Type very slowly/fast (differently than your baseline)
2. Wait 10-15 seconds
3. **When freeze happens**, say:
   > "The system detected behavior that doesn't match my profile. The browser froze for security."

4. **Point to modal**:
   > "Now I can choose how to respond with three options."

---

### **Part 4: Security Responses** (2 minutes)

**Option 1: Green Button**
**Say**: 
> "If it's just me typing unusually, I can restore full access immediately."

**Do**: Click green button, show normal access restored

**Option 2: Orange Button**
**Say**:
> "If a family member is using my laptop, I can enable limited access mode which blocks passwords and sensitive sites."

**Do**: Trigger another anomaly, click orange button, try to visit a bank → blocked

**Option 3: Red Button**
**Say**:
> "If someone unauthorized accessed my account, this immediately terminates the session and sends me an encrypted email alert."

**Do**: Trigger final anomaly, click red button, show session termination page

### **Problem: Extension won't load**

**Error Message**: "Manifest file is missing or unreadable"

**Fix**:
1. Verify you selected the correct folder:
   - Should be: `C:\AltairAI\DataMerge\behavior-authentication\chrome-extension\`
   - NOT: `C:\AltairAI\DataMerge\behavior-authentication\`
2. Check that `manifest.json` exists in the folder
3. Try "Load unpacked" again

---

### **Problem: Extension loads but shows errors**

**Error Message**: Red text about "service worker" or "content script"

**Fix**:
1. Click the **"Errors"** button on extension card
2. Read the error message
3. Common issues:
   - **"service-worker.js not found"**: Check file exists in `background/` folder
   - **"Failed to load"**: Refresh extension (click refresh icon)
4. If errors persist: Remove extension, reload it

---

### **Problem: Stats showing 0 keystrokes**

**Symptoms**: You're typing but keystroke counter stays at 0

**Fix**:
1. **Refresh the webpage** you're typing on (F5)
2. Extension only works on pages loaded AFTER extension installed
3. Try a new tab (Ctrl+T)
4. Don't test on chrome:// pages (they're restricted)

---

### **Problem: Anomaly won't trigger**

**Symptoms**: Typing differently but no alert appears

**Fix**:
1. Type VERY differently (extremely slow or fast)
2. Type for longer (60+ seconds continuously)
3. Check sensitivity in settings (try "High" sensitivity)
4. Verify baseline was trained (check stats > 200 keystrokes)
5. Wait longer (detection can take 15-30 seconds)

---

### **Problem: Security alert doesn't appear**

**Symptoms**: Page freezes but no modal shows

**Fix**:
1. Check if popup blockers are enabled (disable them)
2. Open browser console (F12) → Look for errors
3. Verify `alert/security-alert.html` exists
4. Reload extension and try again

---

### **Problem: Limited access mode not working**

**Symptoms**: Clicked orange button but can still access everything

**Fix**:
1. Check that banner appeared at top of page
2. Refresh the page (F5) for restrictions to apply
3. Try visiting a bank site → Should redirect

## 📊 TALKING POINTS FOR QUESTIONS

### **"How accurate is it?"**
> "The keystroke model achieved 70.5% accuracy on a dataset of 51 users, which is 36 times better than random guessing. The mouse model achieved 58.2% accuracy on 65 users, which is 38 times better than random guessing. Together, they provide strong multi-modal authentication."

### **"Can it be fooled?"**
> "While no system is perfect, behavioral biometrics are very hard to replicate. Each person's typing rhythm is as unique as a fingerprint. An attacker would need to perfectly mimic timing patterns down to milliseconds."

### **"What about privacy?"**
> "All behavioral data is stored locally in Chrome's storage. Nothing is sent to external servers except the encrypted security alerts. Users have full control and can clear data anytime."

### **"How was it trained?"**
> "I used Altair AI Studio's AutoML platform with real-world datasets - the CMU keystroke dynamics dataset and the Balabit mouse dynamics dataset. The AI tested 168 different model variations and selected the best performer."

### **"What about false positives?"**
> "The system uses adaptive learning to update your baseline over time, reducing false positives. The 65% threshold provides a good balance. Users can also adjust sensitivity in settings."

### **"Can this replace passwords?"**
> "It's designed as an additional layer, not a replacement. Think of it as continuous two-factor authentication - your password is what you know, your behavior is what you are."
