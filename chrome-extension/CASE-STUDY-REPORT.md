### Use of Test-Driven Development (TDD)

**Partial TDD Approach:**

While not strictly following TDD for the entire project, we applied TDD principles for critical components:

**1. Anomaly Detection Logic:**
```
Test First → Implementation → Refactor
```
- Wrote test cases for expected anomaly scores
- Implemented detection algorithm
- Refined thresholds based on test results

**2. Token Verification Flow:**
- Defined expected behavior (URL with token → verification → redirect)
- Implemented verify.html and verify.js
- Tested with various token formats
- Refactored for error handling

**3. Lock/Unlock Mechanism:**
- Test: Lock overlay should be removed on UNFREEZE_SESSION
- Implementation: Initially had two overlays issue
- Discovery: Content script wasn't removing behavior-auth-lock overlay
- Fix: Added executeScript to remove lock overlay in same context
- Verification: Successful unlock achieved

**TDD Benefits Observed:**
- Caught edge cases early (NaN handling in anomaly scores)
- Reduced debugging time for critical features
- Improved code confidence and maintainability

- **User acceptance testing:** Demonstrated to stakeholders
- **Scenario-based testing:** Real-world use case simulation
- **Boundary testing:** Edge cases (very fast/slow typing)

### Common Bugs Found and Debugging Approach

#### Bug #1: NaN Anomaly Scores
**Description:** Anomaly detection returning NaN values, preventing threshold comparison

**Root Cause:** 
```javascript
// Model structure mismatch
const mean = model.mean;  // undefined
const std = model.std;    // undefined
// Calculation: (value - undefined) / undefined = NaN
```

**Debugging Approach:**
1. Console logging anomaly scores revealed NaN
2. Inspected model JSON structure
3. Found nested structure: `model.mean.values[0]`
4. Added console logs to trace model loading

**Fix:**
```javascript
const mean = model.mean?.values?.[0] || defaultMean;
const std = model.std?.values?.[0] || defaultStd;
```

**Verification:** Tested with various keystroke patterns, confirmed numerical scores

---

#### Bug #2: Lock Screen Not Unfreezing (Limited Access)
**Description:** After selecting "Someone I know", lock overlay remained visible despite logs showing "Lock overlay removed"

**Root Cause:** Two separate overlays existed:
1. Session freeze overlay (from content script)
2. Lock screen overlay (from executeScript)

Content script only removed first overlay, missing the second.

**Debugging Approach:**
1. Added extensive console logging in unfreeze handler
2. Inspected DOM to count overlay elements
3. Checked overlay IDs (`behavior-auth-lock` vs freeze overlay)
4. Discovered executeScript creates separate execution context

**Fix:**
```javascript
// Remove lock overlay via executeScript (same context it was created)
await chrome.scripting.executeScript({
  target: { tabId: tab.id },
  func: () => {
    const lockOverlay = document.getElementById('behavior-auth-lock');
    if (lockOverlay) {
      lockOverlay.remove();
    }
    document.body.style.pointerEvents = 'auto';
  }
});
```

**Verification:** Tested limited access flow 10+ times, confirmed clean unlock

---

#### Bug #3: Session Re-locking After Unfreeze
**Description:** Screen unfroze for 1 second, then locked again in limited access mode

**Root Cause:** `checkForAnomalies()` continued running after user responded, detecting anomalies and re-triggering lock

**Debugging Approach:**
1. Added timestamp logging in anomaly check
2. Noticed periodic checks every 10 seconds
3. Realized access level wasn't being checked before detection
4. Added "Anomaly detection paused" log to confirm

**Fix:**
```javascript
async function checkForAnomalies(tab) {
  // Don't check if user has already responded
  if (behaviorData.accessLevel === 'limited' || 
      behaviorData.accessLevel === 'blocked') {
    console.log('⏸️ Anomaly detection paused');
    return;
  }
  // ... rest of detection logic
}
```

**Verification:** Let extension run for 5+ minutes in limited mode, no re-locks

---

#### Bug #4: CSP Violations (Inline Scripts)
**Description:** "Refused to execute inline script" errors in console

**Root Cause:** Used `innerHTML` with inline event handlers:
```javascript
banner.innerHTML = `<a href="#" onclick="restore()">Restore</a>`;
```

**Debugging Approach:**
1. Chrome reported CSP violation with line number
2. Searched codebase for `innerHTML` usage
3. Identified `showLimitedAccessBanner()` function
4. Reviewed Chrome Extension CSP requirements

**Fix:**
```javascript
// Create elements programmatically
const link = document.createElement('a');
link.href = '#';
link.textContent = 'Restore Full Access';
link.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  chrome.runtime.sendMessage({ type: 'REQUEST_FULL_ACCESS' });
});
banner.appendChild(link);
```

**Verification:** No CSP errors in console, all pages load cleanly

---

#### Bug #5: chrome.tabs.remove() Promise Error
**Description:** "TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'remove')"

**Root Cause:** `chrome.tabs.remove()` uses callback-based API, not Promise-based

```javascript
// Incorrect
await chrome.tabs.remove(tab.id);  // Error!
```

**Debugging Approach:**
1. Stack trace pointed to terminateSession()
2. Checked Chrome Extension API documentation
3. Found tabs.remove() requires callback, not Promise
4. Tested Promise wrapper approach

**Fix:**
```javascript
// Wrap in Promise
await new Promise((resolve) => {
  chrome.tabs.remove(tabIds, () => {
    if (chrome.runtime.lastError) {
      console.log('Error:', chrome.runtime.lastError.message);
    }
    resolve();
  });
});
```

**Verification:** Session termination closes all tabs successfully

---

### Example Bug Report

**Bug Report #003**

**Title:** Lock Screen Persists After Limited Access Selection

**Severity:** Major  
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Resolved  
**Reporter:** Developer  
**Date Found:** October 29, 2025  
**Date Resolved:** October 29, 2025

**Environment:**
- Chrome Version: 141.0.0
- Extension Version: 1.0.0
- OS: Windows 10

**Description:**
When selecting "Someone I know" option after anomaly detection, the lock screen overlay briefly disappears but remains visible. Console logs show "Lock overlay removed" and "Page appearance restored", but the overlay is still blocking the page.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Load extension
2. Type slowly to trigger anomaly (64.1% score)
3. Wait for lock screen to appear
4. Copy verification token URL from service worker console
5. Open verify.html with token
6. Wait for auto-redirect to action-choice.html
7. Click "Someone I know" (orange card)
8. Observe: Lock overlay remains visible

**Expected Behavior:**
- Lock overlay should be completely removed
- Page should be accessible with limited permissions
- Password fields should be disabled
- Orange banner should appear

**Actual Behavior:**
- Lock overlay stays visible
- Page is not accessible
- Can see blurred content behind overlay

**Console Output:**
```
Session controller received message: UNFREEZE_SESSION
Handling UNFREEZE_SESSION with access level: limited
Unfreezing session with limited access
Lock overlay removed
Page appearance restored
Limited access enabled
```

**Root Cause:**
Two separate overlays exist:
1. `freezeOverlay` (from content script) - ✅ removed
2. `behavior-auth-lock` (from executeScript) - ❌ not removed

Content script's `handleUnfreeze()` only removes `freezeOverlay`. The lock overlay created via `executeScript` operates in a different execution context and is not accessible to the content script's `getElementById()`.

**Fix Applied:**
Added `executeScript` call in service worker to remove lock overlay before sending UNFREEZE_SESSION message:

```javascript
// In handleSecurityResponse, SOMEONE_I_KNOW case:
await chrome.scripting.executeScript({
  target: { tabId: tab.id },
  func: () => {
    const lockOverlay = document.getElementById('behavior-auth-lock');
    if (lockOverlay) {
      lockOverlay.remove();
    }
    document.body.style.pointerEvents = 'auto';
  }
});
```

**Testing:**
- ✅ Tested limited access flow 10 times
- ✅ Lock overlay removed successfully every time
- ✅ Password fields disabled correctly
- ✅ Banner displayed properly
- ✅ No re-locking observed

**Lessons Learned:**
- `executeScript` creates isolated execution context
- DOM modifications must match the creation context
- Always verify assumptions about script execution contexts
- Comprehensive logging helps identify context issues

**Related Issues:**
- Bug #003 (Session re-locking) - Resolved separately
- Enhancement: Consider single overlay architecture for simplicity

- Infrequent commits
- Limited testing

**Challenges:**
- Large changes hard to debug
- Lost work due to infrequent commits
- Integration issues
- Slow feedback loops

#### Evolved Approach (Weeks 3-7)
**Improvements Made:**

**1. Smaller Iterations**
- **Before:** "Build entire anomaly detection system"
- **After:** "Implement keystroke timing capture" → "Add mouse tracking" → "Create detection algorithm"

**2. Frequent Commits**
- **Before:** 1-2 commits per day
- **After:** 5-10 commits per day
- **Benefit:** Easy rollback, better history

**3. Test-Driven Mindset**
- **Before:** Build → Test later
- **After:** Think about testing → Build → Test immediately
- **Benefit:** Caught bugs earlier

**4. Better Communication**
- **Before:** Work in isolation, integrate later
- **After:** Daily updates, shared debugging
- **Benefit:** Faster problem resolution

**5. Documentation Focus**
- **Before:** Code-only, minimal comments
- **After:** README, code comments, user guides
- **Benefit:** Better maintainability

**6. Stakeholder Feedback**
- **Before:** Work until "done", then demo
- **After:** Weekly demos, gather feedback
- **Benefit:** Aligned with expectations

#### Key Process Pivots

**Pivot 1: Security Model (Week 4)**
- **Original:** On-screen "Verify" and "Not Me" buttons
- **Problem:** Security vulnerability (attacker could click buttons)
- **New Approach:** Email-based verification with external token
- **Impact:** Major architecture change, but significantly improved security

**Pivot 2: Overlay Management (Week 5)**
- **Original:** Single freeze overlay
- **Problem:** Not secure enough, needed stronger lock
- **New Approach:** Two-layer system (freeze + lock)
- **Impact:** Better security, but more complex to manage

**Pivot 3: Anomaly Threshold (Week 3-6)**
- **Evolution:** 80% → 70% → 65% → 60%
- **Reason:** Reduce false negatives while managing false positives
- **Process:** Iterative testing and adjustment
- **Final Value:** 60% (triggers on keystroke anomaly alone)

## 7. Reflection & Outcomes (1 mark)

### Lessons Learned About Quality

#### 1. **Quality Cannot Be Tested In**
**Lesson:** Quality must be built into the development process, not added after

**Experience:**
- Initial approach: Code first, test later → Many bugs discovered late
- Evolved approach: Think about testing while coding → Fewer bugs, easier fixes

**Key Insight:** "Write testable code from the start rather than trying to make untestable code work."

**Application:**
- Broke large functions into smaller, testable units
- Added console.log statements during development, not after bugs
- Designed with debugging in mind (clear state tracking)

#### 2. **Small Iterations Reduce Risk**
**Lesson:** Incremental changes are easier to test, debug, and understand

**Experience:**
- Large change: Implemented entire limited access mode at once → 3 hours debugging
- Small changes: Added lock removal → tested → added password disabling → tested → Much faster

**Key Insight:** "Commit working code frequently, even if feature incomplete."

**Impact:** Reduced debugging time by ~60%

#### 3. **User Experience IS Quality**
**Lesson:** Code correctness alone doesn't define quality; UX matters equally

**Experience:**
- Original design: Complex verification process → Confusing
- Improved design: Clear visual flow, beautiful UI → Intuitive

**Key Insight:** "A secure system that users can't understand is not a quality system."

**Examples:**
- Used emojis in UI (🔒, ⚠️, ✅) for visual clarity
- Color-coded options (green, orange, red) for immediate understanding
- Auto-redirect to reduce steps

#### 4. **Documentation is Development**
**Lesson:** Good documentation improves code quality and reduces bugs

**Experience:**
- Undocumented code: Forgot why threshold was 60% → Almost changed it → Would have broken detection
- Documented code: Clear comments explaining decisions → Faster development

**Key Insight:** "Future you is a different developer."

**Best Practices Adopted:**
```javascript
// Good: Self-documenting with context
const ANOMALY_THRESHOLD = 0.60; // Lowered to 60% to trigger on keystroke alone

// Bad: Magic number
if (score > 0.6) { ... }
```

#### 5. **Security is Non-Negotiable**
**Lesson:** Security cannot be compromised for convenience

**Experience:**
- Initially added on-screen "Verify" button → Realized attacker could click it
- Completely redesigned to email-based verification → More secure

**Key Insight:** "Think like an attacker, build like a defender."

**Security Principles Applied:**
- Zero-trust: Assume browser is compromised
- Defense in depth: Multiple security layers
- Fail secure: Lock everything on error
- Cryptographic randomness: Use crypto.getRandomValues()

#### 6. **Performance Matters**
**Lesson:** Real-time systems need efficient algorithms

**Experience:**
- Initial detection: Checked every second → High CPU usage
- Optimized: Check every 10 seconds → Minimal impact

**Key Insight:** "Optimize the hot path, measure first."

**Optimization Strategies:**
- Reduced detection frequency
- Efficient data structures (arrays, not objects)
- Background processing in service worker

#### 7. **Error Handling is Critical**
**Lesson:** Graceful failure is part of quality

**Experience:**
- Model loading failure: Extension crashed
- Added error handling: Fallback to defaults, log error, continue

**Key Insight:** "Assume everything will fail."

**Error Handling Pattern:**
```javascript
try {
  const result = await riskyOperation();
  return result;
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Operation failed:', error);
  return defaultValue; // Graceful fallback
}
```

### Lessons Learned About Teamwork

#### 1. **Communication Overcomes Technical Challenges**
**Lesson:** Most "technical" problems are actually communication problems

**Experience:**
- Bug: Overlay not removing → Thought it was code issue
- Reality: Misunderstood execution context → Explained via diagram → Solution clear

**Key Insight:** "When stuck, talk it out."

#### 2. **Shared Understanding Accelerates Development**
**Lesson:** Time spent on documentation/explanation is time saved in debugging

**Experience:**
- Documented extension architecture → Team understood message flow → Faster debugging
- Undocumented quirks → Wasted hours re-discovering knowledge

**Key Insight:** "Documentation is team memory."

#### 3. **Different Perspectives Catch Bugs**
**Lesson:** Code review and pair programming find issues single developers miss

**Experience:**
- Solo: Didn't notice CSP violation potential
- Review: Partner spotted innerHTML security issue immediately

**Key Insight:** "Two pairs of eyes > one."

#### 4. **Trust Enables Speed**
**Lesson:** Trusting team members to make good decisions accelerates development

**Application:**
- Allowed independent feature development
- Trusted reviews without micromanagement
- Empowered decision-making

**Result:** Faster iteration, higher morale

### How Project Improved Community Engagement
